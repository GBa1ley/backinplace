									<h2>Why Swansea and Morecambe bay?</h2>
								</header>
									<p>This is the first of two events, the second will be held in March 2022 in Morecombe Bay.  Both places are being transformed – Swansea through the City Deal, Council investment and the activities of the Universities; in Morecombe Bay the aspirations for change are exemplified by the Eden North Project”</p>
<!--								<p>The first is Swansea Bay, where Back in Place will be convened; the second, in February next year, will be in Morecambe Bay, where Place Transformed with be convened. The former is being transformed by investments at the University, in the city itself and through regional funds; the latter is going through similar transformations, exemplified by the ambitions for Eden North.</p>-->
